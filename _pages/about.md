O sol brilha sempre, só temos de aprender a reconhecê-lo por detrás das nuvens.

We want to
* go for the first time with the camper
* drive through Portugal
* have fun

And we do not want to start the whole thing unprepared.
* therefore I am starting to learn Portuguese
* we will learn about portuguese history
* we do a lot of research on the internet

Here we collect our findings.
Maybe you would like to have a look here as well. 
Maybe one or the other idea will come up for you. 

Who knows - maybe one or the other will even contact me.

Whatever your motives are for hanging around here, enjoy your time here.
