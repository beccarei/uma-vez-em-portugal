We want to travel around Portugal in a camper van, from river bathing spot to river bathing spot. 

We want to see a lot of nature and meet people along the way. We will also visit a museum or two.
We will start and finish in Lisbon. And in between we will be inspired. 

The N2 appeals to us very much - what it will be in the end will show us the way. 
We have collected a few ideas of places we might visit, so that we can always see what is close by along the way.

We're looking forward to it.

Maybe there is something for you too, or you have ideas for us. Then write to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
