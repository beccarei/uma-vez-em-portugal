# How do you learn a language?

- a clear goal helps immensely
- a good course that fits into your schedule
- a tool that helps you to repeat the learning content at certain intervals

## A clear Goal
That are the trip to Portugal and the wish to get in contact with locals, which is much easier, if you at least know a little of the language spoken there.

## A good Course
Scheduled learning time helps a lot to achieve goals. Also little chunks help, to achieve goals more quickly. 
I found a course, that offers the learning opportunity in little 3 minute chunks. For me that is perfect.

## A Tool for Learning
The best learning system in my eyes is the good old index card box. 
You divide it in different apartments and throughout learning the words and phrases you move them to the compartments closer to the end. 
That is called "spaced repetiton system". 

Nowadays you do not need physical index cards. You can use an app, that helps you learning the words.

You still need stamina and then it will work out with the language. :)
