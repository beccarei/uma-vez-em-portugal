# Praias  Fluviaias

My Portuguese is still in its infancy, so the description on the pages will be in English.

We want to drive in a summer with the camper a few weeks through Portugal. The tour should be recreation and at the same time we want to see quite a lot of the country without being constantly on the road.

After a lot of back and forth we came up with the idea to just drive from river bathing place to river bathing place and in between take some culture along the way.

Here I collect our notes so that we always have them handy on the way.

It starts with a collection of river bathing spots in Maps that I found during my research.
